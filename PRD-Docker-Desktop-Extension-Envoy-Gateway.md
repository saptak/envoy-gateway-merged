# Product Requirements Document: Docker Desktop Extension for Envoy Gateway

## 1. Executive Summary

The Docker Desktop Extension for Envoy Gateway aims to simplify the deployment, configuration, and management of Envoy Gateway within Docker Desktop environments. This extension will provide developers with an intuitive graphical interface to leverage Envoy Gateway's API gateway capabilities without requiring deep knowledge of Kubernetes or Envoy configuration syntax.

## 2. Product Vision

Enable developers to easily deploy, configure, and manage Envoy Gateway directly from Docker Desktop, streamlining the process of setting up API gateways for microservices applications.

## 3. Target Users

- Application developers working with microservices
- DevOps engineers managing containerized applications
- Platform engineers implementing API gateway solutions
- Development teams needing simplified gateway configuration

## 4. User Problems Addressed

- Complex configuration of Envoy Gateway through YAML files
- Difficulty visualizing traffic flow through the gateway
- Challenges in debugging gateway configuration issues
- Time-consuming setup and configuration of Envoy Gateway
- Limited visibility into gateway performance and metrics
