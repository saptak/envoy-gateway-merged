# Docker Desktop Extension for Envoy Gateway

This repository contains the implementation of a Docker Desktop Extension for Envoy Gateway, providing a user-friendly interface to deploy, configure, and manage Envoy Gateway directly from Docker Desktop.

## Project Overview

The Docker Desktop Extension for Envoy Gateway simplifies the process of setting up and managing API gateways for containerized applications. It provides a graphical interface for tasks that would otherwise require complex YAML configurations and command-line operations.
